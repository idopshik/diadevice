This piace of hardware meant to emulate car motor sensors.
It also can give control impulses to high voltage coils and stepper motors. Could give
protected power supply (to locate shorts to ground)
This program is relieble and robust. There are no bugs. Although it look's
overthelmingly complicated(at least for me)
I wroute it using big wide monitor - it's the reason why comment are over 80 ch ruler.


Device is working already and turned out to be very helpful.
