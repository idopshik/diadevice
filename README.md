This piace of hardware meant to emulate car motor sensors.
It also can give control impulses to high voltage coils and stepper motors. Could give
protected power supply (to locate shorts to ground)
This program is relieble and robust. There are no bugs. Although it look's
overthelmingly complicated - works well on device.


Device is working already and turned out to be very helpful.
