This piace of hardware meant to emulate car electricity sensors.
It also can give control impulses to high voltage coils and stepper motors. Can give
rotected power supply (to locate shorts to ground)
This program is relieble and robust. There are no bugs. Although it look's
overthelmingly complicated(at least for me)

Device is working already and turned out to be very helpful.
